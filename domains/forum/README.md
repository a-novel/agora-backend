# Forum

The forum is the place where users can freely, and massively post content about writing.

Posts are controlled under various categories, to achieve a specific goal:
 - **Improvement Requests**: users can submit a scene from their novel, to receive improvement suggestions on it.

## Improvement Requests

Improvement Requests are posts that users can submit to receive improvement suggestions on their writing.

An improvement request consists of a title, that summarizes the text and its intent, and a scene (short extract) to
be improved.

The improvement request may be updated, however the source post is never altered. Instead, when a request gets updated,
a new revision is created, to keep existing suggestions relevant. Optionally, other users can update their suggestions
to the latest revision.
