# Agora des Ã‰crivains

Private repository for Agora backend application.

# Run

```shell
make run
```

> You'll need some signature keys in order to authenticate. To generate some locally, run this command (with the local
> server started):
>  ```shell
>  make rotate-keys
>  ```

# Test

```shell
# Optional, if your local environment is not up.
# docker compose up -d

make test
# Or `make race` to run in race mode.
```

> `make msan` command only works with some Linux instances, so you cannot run it on your mac.
> Check the CI to ensure it passes properly.
